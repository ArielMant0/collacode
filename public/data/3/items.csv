582,3,Semi-supervised Knowledge Transfer for Deep Learning from Private Training Data,"Some machine learning applications involve training data that is sensitive, such as the medical histories of patients in a clinical trial. A model may inadvertently and implicitly store some of its training data; careful analysis of the model may therefore reveal sensitive information.  To address this problem, we demonstrate a generally applicable approach to providing strong privacy guarantees for training data: Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE). The approach combines, in a black-box fashion, multiple models trained with disjoint datasets, such as records from different subsets of users. Because they rely directly on sensitive data, these models are not published, but instead used as ''teachers'' for a ''student'' model.  The student learns to predict an output chosen by noisy voting among all of the teachers, and cannot directly access an individual teacher or the underlying data or parameters. The student's privacy properties can be understood both intuitively (since no single teacher and thus no single dataset dictates the student's training) and formally, in terms of differential privacy.  These properties hold even if an adversary can not only query the student but also inspect its internal workings.  Compared with previous work, the approach imposes only weak assumptions on how teachers are trained: it applies to any model, including non-convex models like DNNs. We achieve state-of-the-art privacy/utility trade-offs on MNIST and SVHN thanks to an improved privacy analysis and semi-supervised learning.",,,"Nicolas Papernot, Martín Abadi, Úlfar Erlingsson, Ian Goodfellow, Kunal Talwar",accepted
583,3,Learning to Generate Samples from Noise through Infusion Training,"In this work, we investigate a novel training procedure to learn a generative model as the transition operator of a Markov chain, such that, when applied repeatedly on an unstructured random noise sample, it will denoise it into a sample that matches the target distribution from the training set. The novel training procedure to learn this progressive denoising operation involves sampling from a slightly different chain than the model chain used for generation in the absence of a denoising target. In the training chain we infuse information from the training target example that we would like the chains to reach with a high probability. The thus learned transition operator is able to produce quality and varied samples in a small number of steps. Experiments show competitive results compared to the samples generated with a basic Generative Adversarial Net.",,,"Florian Bordes, Sina Honari, Pascal Vincent",accepted
584,3,Multilayer Recurrent Network Models of Primate Retinal Ganglion Cell Responses,"Developing accurate predictive models of sensory neurons is vital to understanding sensory processing and brain computations. The current standard approach to modeling neurons is to start with simple models and to incrementally add interpretable features. An alternative approach is to start with a more complex model that captures responses accurately, and then probe the fitted model structure to understand the neural computations. Here, we show that a multitask recurrent neural network (RNN) framework provides the flexibility necessary to model complex computations of neurons that cannot be captured by previous methods. Specifically, multilayer recurrent neural networks that share features across neurons outperform generalized linear models (GLMs) in predicting the spiking responses of parasol ganglion cells in the primate retina to natural images. The networks achieve good predictive performance given surprisingly small amounts of experimental training data. Additionally, we present a novel GLM-RNN hybrid model with separate spatial and temporal processing components which provides insights into the aspects of retinal processing better captured by the recurrent neural networks.",,,"Eleanor Batty, Josh Merel, Nora Brackbill, Alexander Heitman, Alexander Sher, Alan Litke, E.J.

585,3,Unsupervised Cross-Domain Image Generation,"We study the problem of transferring a sample in one domain to an analog sample in another domain. Given two related domains, S and T, we would like to learn a generative function G that maps an input sample from S to the domain T, such that the output of a given representation function f, which accepts inputs in either domains, would remain unchanged. Other than f, the training data is unsupervised and consist of a set of samples from each domain, without any mapping between them. The Domain Transfer Network (DTN) we present employs a compound loss function that includes a multiclass GAN loss, an f preserving component, and a regularizing component that encourages G to map samples from T to themselves. We apply our method to visual domains including digits and face images and demonstrate its ability to generate convincing novel images of previously unseen entities, while preserving their identity.",,,"Yaniv Taigman, Adam Polyak, Lior Wolf",accepted
586,3,Deep Predictive Coding Networks for Video Prediction and Unsupervised Learning,"While great strides have been made in using deep learning algorithms to solve supervised learning tasks, the problem of unsupervised learning - leveraging unlabeled examples to learn about the structure of a domain - remains a difficult unsolved challenge. Here, we explore prediction of future frames in a video sequence as an unsupervised learning rule for learning about the structure of the visual world. We describe a predictive neural network (""PredNet"") architecture that is inspired by the concept of ""predictive coding"" from the neuroscience literature. These networks learn to predict future frames in a video sequence, with each layer in the network making local predictions and only forwarding deviations from those predictions to subsequent network layers. We show that these networks are able to robustly learn to predict the movement of synthetic (rendered) objects, and that in doing so, the networks learn  internal representations that are useful for decoding latent object parameters (e.g. pose) that support object recognition with fewer training views. We also show that these networks can scale to complex natural image streams (car-mounted camera videos), capturing key aspects of both egocentric movement and the movement of objects in the visual scene, and the representation learned in this setting is useful for estimating the steering angle. These results suggest that prediction represents a powerful framework for unsupervised learning, allowing for implicit learning of object and scene structure.",,,"William Lotter, Gabriel Kreiman, David Cox",accepted
587,3,Training Agent for First-Person Shooter Game with Actor-Critic Curriculum Learning,"In this paper, we propose a novel framework for training vision-based agent for First-Person Shooter (FPS) Game, in particular Doom. Our framework combines the state-of-the-art reinforcement learning approach (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) model) with curriculum learning. Our model is simple in design and only uses game states from the AI side, rather than using opponents' information. On a known map, our agent won 10 out of the 11 attended games and the champion of Track1 in ViZDoom AI Competition 2016 by a large margin, 35\% higher score than the second place.",,,"Yuxin Wu, Yuandong Tian",accepted
588,3,Neuro-Symbolic Program Synthesis,"Recent years have seen the proposal of a number of neural architectures for the problem of Program Induction. Given a set of input-output examples, these architectures are able to learn mappings that generalize to new test inputs. While achieving impressive results, these approaches have a number of important limitations: (a) they are computationally expensive and hard to train, (b) a model has to be trained for each task (program) separately, and (c) it is hard to interpret or verify the correctness of the learnt mapping (as it is defined by a neural network). In this paper, we propose a novel technique, Neuro-Symbolic Program Synthesis, to overcome the above-mentioned problems. Once trained, our approach can automatically construct computer programs in a domain-specific language that are consistent with a set of input-output examples provided at test time. Our method is based on two novel neural modules. The first module, called the cross correlation I/O network, given a set of input-output examples, produces a continuous representation of the set of I/O examples. The second module, the Recursive-Reverse-Recursive Neural Network (R3NN), given the continuous representation of the examples, synthesizes a program by incrementally expanding partial programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the rich and complex domain of regular expression based string transformations. Experiments show that the R3NN model is not only able to construct programs from new input-output examples, but it is also able to construct new programs for tasks that it had never observed before during training.",,,"Emilio Parisotto, Abdel-rahman Mohamed, Rishabh Singh, Lihong Li, Dengyong Zhou, Pushmeet Kohli",accepted
589,3,Autoencoding Variational Inference For Topic Models,"Topic models are one of the most popular methods for learning representations of text, but a major challenge is that any change to the topic model requires mathematically deriving a new inference algorithm. A promising approach to address this problem is autoencoding variational Bayes (AEVB), but it has proven diffi- cult to apply to topic models in practice. We present what is to our knowledge the first effective AEVB based inference method for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), which we call Autoencoded Variational Inference For Topic Model (AVITM). This model tackles the problems caused for AEVB by the Dirichlet prior and by component collapsing. We find that AVITM matches traditional methods in accuracy with much better inference time. Indeed, because of the inference network, we find that it is unnecessary to pay the computational cost of running variational optimization on test data. Because AVITM is black box, it is readily applied to new topic models. As a dramatic illustration of this, we present a new topic model called ProdLDA, that replaces the mixture model in LDA with a product of experts. By changing only one line of code from LDA, we find that ProdLDA yields much more interpretable topics, even if LDA is trained via collapsed Gibbs sampling.",,,"Akash Srivastava, Charles Sutton",accepted
590,3,A Simple but Tough-to-Beat Baseline for Sentence Embeddings,"The success of neural network methods for computing word embeddings has motivated methods for generating semantic embeddings of longer pieces of text, such as sentences and paragraphs. Surprisingly, Wieting et al (ICLR'16) showed that such complicated methods are outperformed, especially in out-of-domain (transfer learning) settings, by simpler methods involving mild retraining of word embeddings and basic linear regression. The  method of Wieting et al. requires retraining with a substantial labeled dataset such as Paraphrase Database (Ganitkevitch et al., 2013).   The current paper goes further, showing that the following completely unsupervised sentence embedding is a formidable baseline: Use word embeddings computed using one of the popular methods on unlabeled corpus like Wikipedia, represent the sentence by a weighted average of the word vectors, and then modify them a bit using PCA/SVD. This weighting improves performance by about 10% to 30% in textual similarity tasks, and beats sophisticated supervised methods including RNN's and LSTM's. It even improves Wieting et al.'s embeddings.   This simple method should be used as the baseline to beat in future, especially when labeled training data is scarce or nonexistent.   The paper also gives a theoretical explanation of the success of the above unsupervised method using a latent variable generative model for sentences, which is a simple extension of the model in Arora et al. (TACL'16) with new ""smoothing"" terms that allow for  words occurring out of context, as well as high probabilities for words like and, not in all contexts.",,,"Sanjeev Arora, Yingyu Liang, Tengyu Ma",accepted
591,3,Learning to Perform Physics Experiments via Deep Reinforcement Learning,"When encountering novel objects, humans are able to infer a wide range of physical properties such as mass, friction and deformability by interacting with them in a goal driven way. This process of active interaction is in the same spirit as a scientist performing experiments to discover hidden facts. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have yielded machines that can achieve superhuman performance in Go, Atari, natural language processing, and complex control problems; however, it is not clear that these systems can rival the scientific intuition of even a young child. In this work we introduce a basic set of tasks that require agents to estimate properties such as mass and cohesion of objects in an interactive simulated environment where they can manipulate the objects and observe the consequences. We found that deep reinforcement learning methods can learn to perform the experiments necessary to discover such hidden properties. By systematically manipulating the problem difficulty and the cost incurred by the agent for performing experiments, we found that agents learn different strategies that balance the cost of gathering information against the cost of making mistakes in different situations.  We also compare our learned experimentation policies to randomized baselines and show that the learned policies lead to better predictions.",,,"Misha Denil, Pulkit Agrawal, Tejas D Kulkarni, Tom Erez, Peter Battaglia, Nando de Freitas",accepted
592,3,Improving Policy Gradient by Exploring Under-appreciated Rewards,"This paper presents a novel form of policy gradient for model-free reinforcement learning (RL) with improved exploration properties. Current policy-based methods use entropy regularization to encourage undirected exploration of the reward landscape, which is ineffective in high dimensional spaces with sparse rewards. We propose a more directed exploration strategy that promotes exploration of under-appreciated reward regions. An action sequence is considered under-appreciated if its log-probability under the current policy under-estimates its resulting reward. The proposed exploration strategy is easy to implement, requiring only small modifications to the standard REINFORCE algorithm. We evaluate the approach on a set of algorithmic tasks that have long challenged RL methods. We find that our approach reduces hyper-parameter sensitivity and demonstrates significant improvements over baseline methods. Notably, the approach is able to solve a benchmark multi-digit addition task. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a pure RL method has solved addition using only reward feedback.",,,"Ofir Nachum, Mohammad Norouzi, Dale Schuurmans",accepted
593,3,Designing Neural Network Architectures using Reinforcement Learning,"At present, designing convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures requires both human expertise and labor. New architectures are handcrafted by careful experimentation or modified from a handful of existing networks. We introduce MetaQNN, a meta-modeling algorithm based on reinforcement learning to automatically generate high-performing CNN architectures for a given learning task. The learning agent is trained to sequentially choose CNN layers using $Q$-learning with an $\epsilon$-greedy exploration strategy and experience replay. The agent explores a large but finite space of possible architectures and iteratively discovers designs with improved performance on the learning task. On image classification benchmarks, the agent-designed networks (consisting of only standard convolution, pooling, and fully-connected layers) beat existing networks designed with the same layer types and are competitive against the state-of-the-art methods that use more complex layer types. We also outperform existing meta-modeling approaches for network design on image classification tasks.",,,"Bowen Baker, Otkrist Gupta, Nikhil Naik, Ramesh Raskar",accepted
594,3,TopicRNN: A Recurrent Neural Network with Long-Range Semantic Dependency,"In this paper, we propose TopicRNN, a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based language model designed to directly capture the global semantic meaning relating words in a document via latent topics. Because of their sequential nature, RNNs are good at capturing the local structure of a word sequence – both semantic and syntactic – but might face difficulty remembering long-range dependencies. Intuitively, these long-range dependencies are of semantic nature. In contrast, latent topic models are able to capture the global underlying semantic structure of a document but do not account for word ordering. The proposed TopicRNN model integrates the merits of RNNs and latent topic models: it captures local (syntactic) dependencies using an RNN and global (semantic) dependencies using latent topics. Unlike previous work on contextual RNN language modeling, our model is learned end-to-end. Empirical results on word prediction show that TopicRNN outperforms existing contextual RNN baselines. In addition, TopicRNN can be used as an unsupervised feature extractor for documents. We do this for sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset and report an error rate of 6.28%. This is comparable to the state-of-the-art 5.91% resulting from a semi-supervised approach. Finally, TopicRNN also yields sensible topics, making it a useful alternative to document models such as latent Dirichlet allocation.",,,"Adji B.

595,3,Deep Information Propagation,"We study the behavior of untrained neural networks whose weights and biases are randomly distributed using mean field theory. We show the existence of depth scales that naturally limit the maximum depth of signal propagation through these random networks. Our main practical result is to show that random networks may be trained precisely when information can travel through them. Thus, the depth scales that we identify provide bounds on how deep a network may be trained for a specific choice of hyperparameters. As a corollary to this, we argue that in networks at the edge of chaos, one of these depth scales diverges. Thus arbitrarily deep networks may be trained only sufficiently close to criticality. We show that the presence of dropout destroys the order-to-chaos critical point and therefore strongly limits the maximum trainable depth for random networks. Finally, we develop a mean field theory for backpropagation and we show that the ordered and chaotic phases correspond to regions of vanishing and exploding gradient respectively.",,,"Samuel S.

596,3,On Detecting Adversarial Perturbations,"Machine learning and  deep learning in particular has advanced tremendously on perceptual tasks in recent years. However, it remains vulnerable against adversarial perturbations of the input that have been crafted specifically to fool the system while being quasi-imperceptible to a human. In this work, we propose to augment deep neural networks with a small ``detector'' subnetwork which is trained on the binary classification task of distinguishing genuine data from data containing adversarial perturbations. Our method is orthogonal to prior work on addressing adversarial perturbations, which has mostly focused on making the classification network itself more robust.  We show empirically that adversarial perturbations can be detected surprisingly well even though they are quasi-imperceptible to humans. Moreover, while the detectors have been trained to detect only a specific adversary, they generalize to similar and weaker adversaries. In addition, we propose an adversarial attack that fools both the classifier and the detector and a novel training procedure for the detector that counteracts this attack.",,,"Jan Hendrik Metzen, Tim Genewein, Volker Fischer, Bastian Bischoff",accepted
597,3,Learning Invariant Representations Of Planar Curves ,"We propose a metric learning framework for the construction of invariant geometric functions of planar curves for the Euclidean and Similarity group of transformations. We leverage on the representational power of convolutional neural networks to compute these geometric quantities. In comparison with axiomatic constructions, we show that the invariants approximated by the learning architectures have better numerical qualities such as robustness to noise, resiliency to sampling, as well as the ability to adapt to occlusion and partiality. Finally, we develop a novel multi-scale representation in a similarity metric learning paradigm.",,,"Gautam Pai, Aaron Wetzler, Ron Kimmel",accepted
598,3,Inductive Bias of Deep Convolutional Networks through Pooling Geometry,"Our formal understanding of the inductive bias that drives the success of convolutional networks on computer vision tasks is limited. In particular, it is unclear what makes hypotheses spaces born from convolution and pooling operations so suitable for natural images. In this paper we study the ability of convolutional networks to model correlations among regions of their input. We theoretically analyze convolutional arithmetic circuits, and empirically validate our findings on other types of convolutional networks as well. Correlations are formalized through the notion of separation rank, which for a given partition of the input, measures how far a function is from being separable. We show that a polynomially sized deep network supports exponentially high separation ranks for certain input partitions, while being limited to polynomial separation ranks for others. The network's pooling geometry effectively determines which input partitions are favored, thus serves as a means for controlling the inductive bias. Contiguous pooling windows as commonly employed in practice favor interleaved partitions over coarse ones, orienting the inductive bias towards the statistics of natural images. Other pooling schemes lead to different preferences, and this allows tailoring the network to data that departs from the usual domain of natural imagery. In addition to analyzing deep networks, we show that shallow ones support only linear separation ranks, and by this gain insight into the benefit of functions brought forth by depth - they are able to efficiently model strong correlation under favored partitions of the input.",,,"Nadav Cohen, Amnon Shashua",accepted
599,3,Hierarchical Multiscale Recurrent Neural Networks,"Learning both hierarchical and temporal representation has been among the long- standing challenges of recurrent neural networks. Multiscale recurrent neural networks have been considered as a promising approach to resolve this issue, yet there has been a lack of empirical evidence showing that this type of models can actually capture the temporal dependencies by discovering the latent hierarchical structure of the sequence. In this paper, we propose a novel multiscale approach, called the hierarchical multiscale recurrent neural network, that can capture the latent hierarchical structure in the sequence by encoding the temporal dependencies with different timescales using a novel update mechanism. We show some evidence that the proposed model can discover underlying hierarchical structure in the sequences without using explicit boundary information. We evaluate our proposed model on character-level language modelling and handwriting sequence generation.",,,"Junyoung Chung, Sungjin Ahn, Yoshua Bengio",accepted
600,3,Learning to Discover Sparse Graphical Models,"We consider structure discovery of undirected graphical models from observational data. Inferring likely structures from few examples is a complex task often requiring the formulation of priors and sophisticated inference procedures. In the setting of Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) a popular estimator is a maximum likelihood objective with a penalization on the precision matrix. Adapting this estimator to capture domain-specific knowledge as priors or a new data likelihood requires great effort. In addition, structure recovery is an indirect consequence of the data-fit term. By contrast, it may be easier to generate training samples of data that arise from graphs with the desired structure properties. We propose here to leverage this latter source of information as training data to learn a function mapping from empirical covariance matrices to estimated graph structures.  Learning this function brings two benefits: it implicitly models the desired structure or sparsity properties to form suitable priors, and it can be tailored to the specific problem of edge structure discovery, rather than maximizing data likelihood. We apply this framework to several real-world problems in structure discovery and show that it can be competitive to standard approaches such as graphical lasso, at a fraction of the execution speed. We use convolutional neural networks to parametrize our estimators due to the compositional structure of the problem. Experimentally, our learnable graph-discovery method trained on synthetic data generalizes well to different data: identifying relevant edges in real data, completely unknown at training time. We find that on genetics, brain imaging, and simulation data we obtain competitive(and generally superior) performance, compared with analytical methods.",,,"Eugene Belilovsky, Kyle Kastner, Gael Varoquaux, Matthew B.

601,3,Surprise-Based Intrinsic Motivation for Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Exploration in complex domains is a key challenge in reinforcement learning, especially for tasks with very sparse rewards. Recent successes in deep reinforcement learning have been achieved mostly using simple heuristic exploration strategies such as $\epsilon$-greedy action selection or Gaussian control noise, but there are many tasks where these methods are insufficient to make any learning progress. Here, we consider more complex heuristics: efficient and scalable exploration strategies that maximize a notion of an agent's surprise about its experiences via intrinsic motivation. We propose to learn a model of the MDP transition probabilities concurrently with the policy, and to form intrinsic rewards that approximate the KL-divergence of the true transition probabilities from the learned model. One of our approximations results in using surprisal as intrinsic motivation, while the other gives the $k$-step learning progress. We show that our incentives enable agents to succeed in a wide range of environments with high-dimensional state spaces and very sparse rewards, including continuous control tasks and games in the Atari RAM domain, outperforming several other heuristic exploration techniques.",,,"Joshua Achiam, Shankar Sastry",rejected
602,3,RenderGAN: Generating Realistic Labeled Data,"Deep Convolutional Neuronal Networks (DCNNs) are showing remarkable performance on many computer vision tasks.  Due to their large parameter space, they require many labeled samples when trained in a supervised setting. The costs of annotating data manually can render the use of DCNNs infeasible.  We present a novel framework called RenderGAN that can generate large amounts of realistic, labeled images by combining a 3D model and the Generative Adversarial Network framework. In our approach, image augmentations (e.g. lighting, background, and detail) are learned from unlabeled data such that the generated images are strikingly realistic while preserving the labels known from the 3D model.  We apply the RenderGAN framework to generate images of barcode-like markers that are attached to honeybees. Training a DCNN on data generated by the RenderGAN yields considerably better performance than training it on various baselines.",,,"Leon Sixt, Benjamin Wild, Tim Landgraf",rejected
603,3,Higher Order Recurrent Neural Networks,"In this paper, we study novel neural network structures to better model long term dependency in sequential data.  We propose to use more memory units to keep track of more preceding states in recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are all recurrently fed to the hidden layers as feedback through different weighted paths. By extending the popular recurrent structure in RNNs, we provide the models with better short-term memory mechanism to learn long term dependency in sequences. Analogous to digital filters in signal processing, we call these structures as higher order RNNs (HORNNs). Similar to RNNs, HORNNs can also be learned using the back-propagation through time method. HORNNs are generally applicable to a variety of sequence modelling tasks. In this work, we have examined HORNNs for the language modeling task using two popular data sets, namely the Penn Treebank (PTB) and English text8. Experimental results have shown that the proposed HORNNs yield the state-of-the-art performance on both data sets, significantly outperforming the regular RNNs as well as the popular LSTMs.",,,"Rohollah Soltani, Hui Jiang",rejected
604,3,Intelligible Language Modeling with Input Switched Affine Networks,"The computational mechanisms by which nonlinear recurrent neural networks (RNNs) achieve their goals remains an open question.  There exist many problem domains where intelligibility of the network model is crucial for deployment. Here we introduce a recurrent architecture composed of input-switched affine transformations, in other words an RNN without any nonlinearity and with one set of weights per input. We show that this architecture achieves near identical performance to traditional architectures on language modeling of Wikipedia text, for the same number of model parameters.  It can obtain this performance with the potential for computational speedup compared to existing methods, by precomputing the composed affine transformations corresponding to longer input sequences.  As our architecture is affine, we are able to understand the mechanisms by which it functions using linear methods. For example, we show how the network linearly combines contributions from the past to make predictions at the current time step. We show how representations for words can be combined in order to understand how context is transferred across word boundaries. Finally, we demonstrate how the system can be executed and analyzed in arbitrary bases to aid understanding.",,,"Jakob Foerster, Justin Gilmer, Jan Chorowski, Jascha Sohl-dickstein, David Sussillo",rejected

DCR is able to predict answers of variable lengths, whereas previous neural RC models primarily focused on predicting single tokens or entities. DCR encodes a document and an input question with recurrent neural networks, and then applies a word-by-word attention mechanism to acquire question-aware representations for the document, followed by the generation of chunk representations and a ranking module to propose the top-ranked chunk as the answer. Experimental results show that DCR could achieve a 66.3% Exact match and 74.7% F1 score on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset.",,,"Yang Yu, Wei Zhang, Bowen Zhou, Kazi Hasan, Mo Yu, Bing Xiang",rejected

To accurately capture the fine grained nonlinear coevolution of these features, we propose a recurrent coevolutionary feature embedding process model, which combines recurrent neural network (RNN) with a multi-dimensional point process model. The RNN learns a nonlinear representation of user and item embeddings which take into account mutual influence between user and item features, and the feature evolution over time. We also develop an efficient stochastic gradient algorithm for learning parameters. Experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate significant improvements in user behavior prediction compared to state-of-the-arts.",,,"Hanjun Dai*, Yichen Wang*, Rakshit Trivedi, Le Song",rejected

We explore the use of blocked Gibbs sampling as an analogue to the human approach, and introduce Coconet, a convolutional neural network in the NADE family of generative models. Despite ostensibly sampling from the same distribution as the NADE ancestral sampling procedure, we find that a blocked Gibbs approach significantly improves sample quality. We provide evidence that this is due to some conditional distributions being poorly modeled. Moreover, we show that even the cheap approximate blocked Gibbs procedure from Yao et al.

While the original technique leads to a loss in accuracy,  we adapt this method to circumvent the quantization artifacts. As a result, our approach produces a text classifier, derived from the fastText approach, which at test time requires only a fraction of the memory compared to the original one, without noticeably sacrificing the quality in terms of classification accuracy. Our experiments carried out on several benchmarks show that our approach typically requires two orders of magnitude less memory than fastText while being only slightly inferior with respect to accuracy. As a result, it outperforms the state of the art by a good margin in terms of the compromise between memory usage and accuracy.",,,"Armand Joulin, Edouard Grave, Piotr Bojanowski, Matthijs Douze, Herve Jegou, Tomas Mikolov",rejected

The high traffic of new products uploaded daily and the dynamic nature of the categories raise the need for machine learning models that can reduce the cost and time of human editors. In this paper, we propose a decision level fusion approach for multi-modal product classification using text and image inputs. We train input specific state-of-the-art deep neural networks for each input source, show the potential of forging them together into a multi-modal architecture and train a novel policy network that learns to choose between them. Finally, we demonstrate that our multi-modal network improves the top-1 accuracy $\%$ over both networks on a real-world large-scale product classification dataset that we collected from Walmart.com. While we focus on image-text fusion that characterizes e-commerce domains, our algorithms can be easily applied to other modalities such as audio, video, physical sensors, etc.",,,"Tom Zahavy, Alessandro Magnani, Abhinandan Krishnan, Shie Mannor",rejected
611,3,Hierarchical Memory Networks,"Memory networks are neural networks with an explicit memory component that can be both read and written to by the network. The memory is often addressed in a soft way using a softmax function, making end-to-end training with backpropagation possible. However, this is not computationally scalable for applications which require the network to read from extremely large memories. On the other hand, it is well known that hard attention mechanisms based on reinforcement learning are challenging to train successfully. In this paper, we explore a form of hierarchical memory network, which can be considered as a hybrid between hard and soft attention memory networks. The memory is organized in a hierarchical structure such that reading from it is done with less computation than soft attention over a flat memory, while also being easier to train than hard attention over a flat memory. Specifically, we propose to incorporate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the training and inference procedures for our hierarchical memory network. We explore the use of various state-of-the art approximate MIPS techniques and report results on SimpleQuestions, a challenging large scale factoid question answering task.",,,"Sarath Chandar, Sungjin Ahn, Hugo Larochelle, Pascal Vincent, Gerald Tesauro, Yoshua Bengio",rejected
612,3,Annealing Gaussian into ReLU: a New Sampling Strategy for Leaky-ReLU RBM,"Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is a bipartite graphical model that is used as the building block in energy-based deep generative models. Due to numerical stability and quantifiability of the likelihood,  RBM is commonly used with Bernoulli units. Here, we consider an alternative member of exponential family RBM with leaky rectified linear units -- called leaky RBM.  We first study the joint and marginal distributions of leaky RBM under different leakiness, which provides us important insights by connecting the leaky RBM model and truncated Gaussian distributions.  The connection leads us to a simple yet efficient method for sampling from this model, where the basic idea is to anneal the leakiness rather than the energy; -- i.e., start from a fully Gaussian/Linear unit and gradually decrease the leakiness over iterations.  This serves as an alternative to the annealing of the temperature parameter and enables numerical estimation of the likelihood that are more efficient and more accurate than the commonly used annealed importance sampling (AIS).  We further demonstrate that the proposed sampling algorithm enjoys faster mixing property than contrastive divergence algorithm, which benefits the training without any additional computational cost.",,,"Chun-Liang Li, Siamak Ravanbakhsh, Barnabas Poczos",rejected

In this paper, we present a model based approach to deep reinforcement learning which we use to solve different tasks simultaneously. We show that our approach not only does not degrade but actually benefits from learning multiple tasks. For our model, we also present a new kind of recurrent neural network inspired by residual networks that decouples memory from computation allowing to model complex environments that do not require lots of memory. The code will be released before ICLR 2017.",,,Asier Mujika,rejected
614,3,Tensorial Mixture Models,"We introduce a generative model, we call Tensorial Mixture Models (TMMs) based on mixtures of basic component distributions over local structures (e.g. patches in an image) where the dependencies between the local-structures are represented by a ""priors tensor"" holding the prior probabilities of assigning a component distribution to each local-structure.  In their general form, TMMs are intractable as the priors tensor is typically of exponential size. However, when the priors tensor is decomposed it gives rise to an arithmetic circuit which in turn transforms the TMM into a Convolutional Arithmetic Circuit (ConvAC). A ConvAC corresponds to a shallow (single hidden layer) network when the priors tensor is decomposed by a CP (sum of rank-1) approach and corresponds to a deep network when the decomposition follows the Hierarchical Tucker (HT) model.  The ConvAC representation of a TMM possesses several attractive properties. First, the inference is tractable and is implemented by a forward pass through a deep network. Second, the architectural design of the model follows the deep networks community design, i.e.,  the structure of TMMs is determined by just two easily understood factors: size of pooling windows and number of channels. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model when tackling the problem of classification with missing data, leveraging TMMs unique ability of tractable marginalization which leads to optimal classifiers regardless of the missingness distribution.",,,"Or Sharir, Ronen Tamari, Nadav Cohen, Amnon Shashua",rejected
615,3,Spatio-Temporal Abstractions in Reinforcement Learning Through Neural Encoding,"Recent progress in the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled to tackle bigger and more challenging tasks. However, the increasing complexity of the problems, as well as the use of more sophisticated models such as Deep Neural Networks (DNN), impedes the understanding of artificial agents behavior. In this work, we present the Semi-Aggregated Markov Decision Process (SAMDP) model. The purpose of the SAMDP modeling is to describe and allow a better understanding of complex behaviors by identifying temporal and spatial abstractions. In contrast to other modeling approaches, SAMDP is built in a transformed state-space that encodes the dynamics of the problem. We show that working with the \emph{right} state representation mitigates the problem of finding spatial and temporal abstractions. We describe the process of building the SAMDP model from observed trajectories and give examples for using it in a toy problem and complicated DQN policies. Finally, we show how using the SAMDP we can monitor the policy at hand and make it more robust.",,,"Nir Baram, Tom Zahavy, Shie Mannor",rejected
616,3,Generative Paragraph Vector,"The recently introduced Paragraph Vector is an efficient method for learning high-quality distributed representations for pieces of texts. However, an inherent limitation of Paragraph Vector is lack of ability to infer distributed representations for texts outside of the training set. To tackle this problem, we introduce a Generative Paragraph Vector, which can be viewed as a probabilistic extension of the Distributed Bag of Words version of Paragraph Vector with a complete generative process. With the ability to infer the distributed representations for unseen texts, we can further incorporate text labels into the model and turn it into a supervised version, namely Supervised Generative Paragraph Vector. In this way, we can leverage the labels paired with the texts to guide the representation learning, and employ the learned model for prediction tasks directly. Experiments on five text classification benchmark collections show that both model architectures can yield superior classification performance over the state-of-the-art counterparts.",,,"Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Yanyan Lan, Jun Xu, Xueqi Cheng",rejected
617,3,LSTM-Based System-Call Language Modeling and Ensemble Method for Host-Based Intrusion Detection,"In computer security, designing a robust intrusion detection system is one of the most fundamental and important problems. In this paper, we propose a system-call language-modeling approach for designing anomaly-based host intrusion detection systems. To remedy the issue of high false-alarm rates commonly arising in conventional methods, we employ a novel ensemble method that blends multiple thresholding classifiers into a single one, making it possible to accumulate `highly normal' sequences. The proposed system-call language model has various advantages leveraged by the fact that it can learn the semantic meaning and interactions of each system call that existing methods cannot effectively consider. Through diverse experiments on public benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, we show that our model possesses high portability, which is one of the key aspects of realizing successful intrusion detection systems.",,,"Gyuwan Kim, Hayoon Yi, Jangho Lee, Yunheung Paek, Sungroh Yoon",rejected
618,3,Deep Variational Canonical Correlation Analysis,"We present deep variational canonical correlation analysis (VCCA), a deep multi-view learning model that extends the latent variable model interpretation of linear CCA~\citep{BachJordan05a} to nonlinear observation models parameterized by deep neural networks (DNNs). Computing the marginal data likelihood, as well as inference of the latent variables, are intractable under this model. We derive a variational lower bound of the data likelihood by parameterizing the posterior density of the latent variables with another DNN, and approximate the lower bound via Monte Carlo sampling. Interestingly, the resulting model resembles that of multi-view autoencoders~\citep{Ngiam_11b}, with the key distinction of an additional sampling procedure at the bottleneck layer. We also propose a variant of VCCA called VCCA-private which can, in addition to the ``common variables'' underlying both views, extract the ``private variables'' within each view. We demonstrate that VCCA-private is able to disentangle the shared and private information for multi-view data without hard supervision.",,,"Weiran Wang, Xinchen Yan, Honglak Lee, Karen Livescu",rejected
619,3,Training Long Short-Term Memory With Sparsified Stochastic Gradient Descent,"Prior work has demonstrated that exploiting the sparsity can dramatically improve the energy efficiency and shrink the memory footprint of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, these sparsity-centric optimization techniques might be less effective for Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), especially for the training phase, because of the significant structural difference between the neurons. To investigate if there is possible sparsity-centric optimization for training LSTM-based RNNs, we studied several applications and observed that there is potential sparsity in the gradients generated in the backward propagation. In this paper, we illustrate why the sparsity exists and propose a simple yet effective thresholding technique to induce further more sparsity during training an LSTM-based RNN training. Experiment results show that the proposed technique can increase the sparsity of linear gate gradients to higher than 80\% without loss of performance, which makes more than 50\% multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations redundant in an entire LSTM training process. These redudant MAC operations can be eliminated by hardware techniques to improve the energy efficiency and training speed of LSTM-based RNNs.",,,"Maohua Zhu, Minsoo Rhu, Jason Clemons, Stephen W.

620,3,Learning Locomotion Skills Using DeepRL: Does the Choice of Action Space Matter?,"The use of deep reinforcement learning allows for high-dimensional state descriptors, but little is known about how the choice of action representation impacts the learning difficulty and the resulting performance. We compare the impact of four different action parameterizations (torques, muscle-activations, target joint angles, and target joint-angle velocities) in terms of learning time, policy robustness, motion quality, and policy query rates. Our results are evaluated on a gait cycle imitation task for multiple planar articulated figures and multiple gaits. We demonstrate that the local feedback provided by higher-level action parameterizations can significantly impact the learning, robustness, and quality of the resulting policies.",,,"Xue Bin Peng, Michiel van de Panne",rejected
621,3,Deep unsupervised learning through spatial contrasting,"Convolutional networks have marked their place over the last few years as the best performing model for various visual tasks. They are, however, most suited for supervised learning from large amounts of labeled data. Previous attempts have been made to use unlabeled data to improve model performance by applying unsupervised techniques. These attempts require different architectures and training methods. In this work we present a novel approach for unsupervised training of Convolutional networks that is based on contrasting between spatial regions within images.  This criterion can be employed within conventional neural net- works and trained using standard techniques such as SGD and back-propagation, thus complementing supervised methods.",,,"Elad Hoffer, Itay Hubara, Nir Ailon",rejected
