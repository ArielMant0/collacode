[{"id":420,"dataset_id":2,"name":"A Modular Degree-of-Interest Specification for the Visual Analysis of Large Dynamic Networks","description":"Large dynamic networks are targets of analysis in many fields. Tracking temporal changes at scale in these networks is challenging due in part to the fact that small changes can be missed or drowned-out by the rest of the network. For static networks, current approaches allow the identification of specific network elements within their context. However, in the case of dynamic networks, the user is left alone with finding salient local network elements and tracking them over time. In this work, we introduce a modular DoI specification to flexibly define what salient changes are and to assign them a measure of their importance in a time-varying setting. The specification takes into account neighborhood structure information, numerical attributes of nodes/edges, and their temporal evolution. A tailored visualization of the DoI specification complements our approach. Alongside a traditional node-link view of the dynamic network, it serves as an interface for the interactive definition of a DoI function. By using it to successively refine and investigate the captured details, it supports the analysis of dynamic networks from an initial view until pinpointing a user's analysis goal. We report on applying our approach to scientific co-authorship networks and give concrete results for the DBLP dataset.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.109","teaser":"a9ad50b3-a0d8-4a36-99fe-b5f7598586ae.png","author":"Abello, James and Hadlak, Steffen and Schumann, Heidrun and Schulz, Hans-J\u00f6rg","year":2013},{"id":421,"dataset_id":2,"name":"Replicable Security Monitoring: Visualizing Time-Variant Graphs of Network Metadata","description":"Monitoring a computer network's security state is a di cult task as network components rarely share their information.

Furthermore, data in a MAP server is volatile and there is no standardized way to preserve and review changes or previous states of a MAP graph. The evolution of such a graph, however, embodies valuable information for the analysis of past incidents and attacks on the network infrastructure.

Nonetheless, given a broad collection of papers it is typically very difficult to grasp important information that could help readers to globally interpret, navigate and then focus on the relevant items for their task. Content-based document maps are visual representations created from evaluating the (dis)similarity amongst the documents, and have been shown to support exploratory tasks in this scenario. Documents are represented by visual markers placed in the 2D space so that documents close share similar content. Albeit the maps allow visually identifying groups of related documents and frontiers between groups, they do not explicitly convey the temporal evolution of a collection. We propose a technique for creating content-based similarity maps of document collections that highlight temporal changes along time. Our solution constructs a sequence of maps from time-stamped sub-sets of the data. It adopts a cumulative backwards strategy to preserve user context across successive time-stamps, i.e., maps do not change drastically from one time stamp to the next, favouring user perception of changes.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2245276.2245469","teaser":"8c1898b4-d507-409f-b664-251ac056e215.png","author":"Alencar, Aretha B and B\u00f6rner, Katy and Paulovich, Fernando V and de Oliveira, Maria Cristina F","year":2012},{"id":426,"dataset_id":2,"name":"Animation, Small Multiples, and the Effect of Mental Map Preservation in Dynamic Graphs","description":"In this paper, we present the results of a human-computer interaction experiment that compared the performance of the animation of dynamic graphs to the presentation of small multiples and the effect that mental map preservation had on the two conditions.

The data sets used in this experiment were derived from standard benchmark data sets of the information visualization community. We found that small multiples gave significantly faster performance than animation overall and for each of our five graph comprehension tasks. In addition, small multiples had significantly more errors than animation for the tasks of determining sets of nodes or edges added to the graph during the same timeslice, although a positive time-error correlation coefficient suggests that, in this case, faster responses did not lead to more errors. This result suggests that, for these two tasks, animation is preferable if accuracy is more important than speed.

Many prior experiments have attempted to verify this principle, with surprisingly little success. These experiments have used several different algorithmic methods, a variety of graph interpretation questions on both real and fabricated data, and different presentation methods. However, none of the results have conclusively demonstrated the importance of mental map preservation on task performance. Our experiment measures the efficacy of the dynamic graph drawing in a different manner: we look at how memorable the evolving graph is, rather than how easy it is to interpret. As observed in the previous studies, we found no significant difference in terms of response time or error rate when preserving the mental map. While preserving the mental map is a good idea in principle, we find that it may not always support performance. However, our qualitative data suggests that, in terms of the user's perception, preserving the mental map makes memorability tasks easier. Our qualitative data also suggests that there may be two features of the dynamic graph drawing that may assist in their memorability: interesting subgraphs that remain visible over time and interesting patterns in node movement. The former is supported by preserving the mental map while the latter is not.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PacificVis.2012.6183578","teaser":"2313392d-c621-4f07-98ed-00c2122283b8.png","author":"Archambault, Daniel and Purchase, Helen C","year":2012},{"id":429,"dataset_id":2,"name":"The \u201cMap\" in the mental map: Experimental results in dynamic graph drawing","description":"Abstract Preserving the mental map is frequently cited by dynamic graph drawing algorithm designers as an important optimization criterion.

These changes are due to user interaction, algorithms, or other underlying processes determining the graph. Typically, users spend a noteworthy amount of time to get familiar with a layout, i.e. they build a mental map [ELMS91]. To retain this map at least partially, consecutive layouts of similar graphs should not differ significantly. Still, each of these layouts should adhere to constraints and criteria that have been specified to improve meaning and readability of a drawing. In [BW97], we introduced random field models for graph layout. As a major advantage of this formulation, many different layout models can be represented uniformly by random variables. This uniformity enables us to now present a framework for dynamic layout of arbitrary random field models. Our approach is based on Bayesian decision theory and formalizes common sense procedures. Example applications of our framework are dynamic versions of two well-known layout models: Eades' spring embedder [Ead84], and Tamassia's bend-minimum orthogonal layout model for plane graphs [Tam87].","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-63938-1_66","teaser":"c44783ca-29fc-48f0-8b2a-35b4f8c5c70c.png","author":"Brandes, Ulrik and Wagner, Dorothea","year":1997},{"id":451,"dataset_id":2,"name":"Visual Unrolling of Network Evolution and the Analysis of Dynamic Discourse","description":"We introduce a method for visualizing evolving networks.

Our primary goal is to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the two methods in fulfilling the need for visualizing evolving networks. Two criteria are derived for assessing visualizations of evolving networks in terms of topological properties and dynamical properties. We examine the animated visualization models of the evolution of botulinum toxin research in terms of its co-citation structure across a 58-year span (1945-2002). The results suggest that although high-degree nodes dominate the structure of MST models, such structures can be inadequate in depicting the essence of how the network evolves because MST removes potentially significant links from high-order shortest paths. In contrast, PFNET models clearly demonstrate their superiority in maintaining the cohesiveness of some of the most pivotal paths, which in turn make the growth animation more predictable and interpretable. We suggest that the design of visualization and modeling tools for network evolution should take the cohesiveness of critical paths into account.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.2003.1249010","teaser":"8b44726a-d243-478c-aad9-79692871a4c3.png","author":"Chen, Chaomei and Morris, Steven","year":2003},{"id":472,"dataset_id":2,"name":"CiteSpace II: Detecting and visualizing emerging trends and transient patterns in scientific literature","description":"This article describes the latest development of a generic approach to detecting and visualizing emerging trends and transient patterns in scientific literature. The work makes substantial theoretical and methodological contributions to progressive knowledge domain visualization. A specialty is conceptualized and visualized as a time-variant duality between two fundamental concepts in information science: research fronts and intellectual bases. A research front is defined as an emergent and transient grouping of concepts and underlying research issues. The intellectual base of a research front is its citation and co-citation footprint in scientific literature\u2014an evolving network of scientific publications cited by research-front concepts. Kleinberg's (2002) burst-detection algorithm is adapted to identify emergent research-front concepts. Freeman's (1979) betweenness centrality metric is used to highlight potential pivotal points of paradigm shift over time. Two complementary visualization views are designed and implemented: cluster views and time-zone views. The contributions of the approach are that (a) the nature of an intellectual base is algorithmically and temporally identified by emergent research-front terms, (b) the value of a co-citation cluster is explicitly interpreted in terms of research-front concepts, and (c) visually prominent and algorithmically detected pivotal points substantially reduce the complexity of a visualized network.

As further applications of the model, we give dynamic drawing algorithms for planar st-digraphs and planar graphs. Our algorithms adopt a variety of representations (e.g., straight line, polyline, visibility) and update the drawing in a smooth way.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1137/S0097539792235724","teaser":"049a4935-f5b1-4a2e-b6fa-5a4869dfaf82.png","author":"Cohen, Robert F and Di Battista, Giuseppe and Tamassia, Roberto and Tollis, Ioannis G","year":1995},{"id":475,"dataset_id":2,"name":"A system for graph-based visualization of the evolution of software","description":"We describe GEVOL, a system that visualizes the evolution of software using a novel graph drawing technique for visualization of large graphs with a temporal component.

One of their major characteristics is the emergence of some global properties stemmed from local interactions between the entities themselves and between the entities and the environment. The structure of these systems as sets of interacting entities leads researchers to model them as graphs. However, their understanding requires most often to consider the dynamics of their evolution. It is indeed not relevant to study some properties out of any temporal consideration. Thus, dynamic graphs seem to be a very suitable model for investigating the emergence and the conservation of some properties. GraphStream is a Java-based library whose main purpose is to help researchers and developers in their daily tasks of dynamic problem modeling and of classical graph management tasks: creation, processing, display, etc. It may also be used, and is indeed already used, for teaching purpose.

One concept of interest is the co-evolution of test code with source code, or how source and test files develop together over time. For example, understanding how the testing pace compares to the development pace can help test managers gauge the effectiveness of their testing strategy. A useful concept that has yet to be effectively incorporated into a co-evolution visualization is co-change. Co-change is a quantity that identifies correlations between software artifacts, and we propose using this to organize our visualization in order to enrich the analysis of co-evolution.

However, the need to draw evolving or dynamic graphs has brought into question many of the assumptions, conventions and layout methods designed to date. For example, social scientists studying evolving social networks have created a demand for visual representations of graphs changing over time. Two common approaches to represent temporal information in graphs include animation of the network and use of static snapshots of the network at different points in time. Here, we report on two experiments, one in a laboratory environment and another using an asynchronous remote web-based platform, Mechanical Turk, to compare the efficiency of animated displays versus static displays. Four tasks are studied with each visual representation, where two characterise overview level information presentation, and two characterise micro level analytical tasks. For the tasks studied in these experiments and within the limits of the experimental system, the results of this study indicate that static representations are generally more effective particularly in terms of time performance, when compared to fully animated movie representations of dynamic networks.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1057/ivs.2010.10","teaser":"bb7d2885-a340-4907-82b0-460488e4323b.png","author":"Farrugia, Michael and Quigley, Aaron J","year":2011},{"id":488,"dataset_id":2,"name":"Exploring temporal ego networks using small multiples and tree-ring layouts","description":"Many of the current dynamic network visualisations methods or techniques rely on node-link force-based models that were originally developed for visualising static network snapshots.

By further supplementing these visualizations with color cues, the resultant animations enable a clearer portrayal of the underlying evolutionary process.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.142","teaser":"9d3cb230-dbdf-4889-86c0-82635d505998.png","author":"Gorochowski, Thomas E and di Bernardo, Mario and Grierson, Claire S","year":2012},{"id":505,"dataset_id":2,"name":"Fast filtering and animation of large dynamic networks","description":"Detecting and visualizing what are the most relevant changes in an evolving network is an open challenge in several domains.

Filtering or compression techniques are often applied to reduce the volume of data without loss of key information vital for a specific analysis goal. Alternatively, visualization is generally accepted as a means of effectively representing large amounts of data. The challenge lies in creating effective and expressive visual representations that not only allows for a global picture, but also enables us to inspect the details of the large data sets. We define the focus of our analysis to be the runtime behavior of features. Static structural visualizations of a system are typically represented in two dimensions. We exploit a third dimension to visually represent the dynamic information, namely object instantiations and message sends. We introduce a novel 3D visualization technique that supports animation of feature behavior and integrates zooming, panning, rotating and on-demand details. As proof of concept, we apply our visualization technique to feature execution traces of an example system.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1148493.1148501","teaser":"5f76d4e7-1f7a-4481-89dd-811e175e1ae9.png","author":"Greevy, Orla and Lanza, Michele and Wysseier, Christoph","year":2006},{"id":507,"dataset_id":2,"name":"Visualizing the Evolution of Compound Digraphs with TimeArcTrees","description":"Compound digraphs are a widely used model in computer science.

In this paper we present a new visualization tool called TimeArcTrees that visualizes weighted, dynamic compound digraphs by drawing a sequence of node-link diagrams in a single view. Compactness is achieved by aligning the nodes of a graph vertically. Edge crossings are reduced by drawing upward and downward edges separately as colored arcs. Horizontal alignment of the instances of the same node in different graphs facilitates comparison of the graphs in the sequence. Many interaction techniques allow to explore the given graphs. Smooth animation supports the user to better track the transitions between views and to preserve his or her mental map.

As dynamic networks exhibit different characteristics, e.g., being of sparse or dense structure, or having a continuous or discrete time line, a variety of visualization techniques have been specifically designed to handle these different aspects of network structure and time. This wide range of existing techniques is well justified, as rarely a single visualization is suitable to cover the entire visual analysis. Instead, visual representations are often switched in the course of the exploration of dynamic graphs as the focus of analysis shifts between the temporal and the structural aspects of the data. To support such a switching in a seamless and intuitive manner, we introduce the concept of in situ visualization- a novel strategy that tightly integrates existing visualization techniques for dynamic networks. It does so by allowing the user to interactively select in a base visualization a region for which a different visualization technique is then applied and embedded in the selection made. This permits to change the way a locally selected group of data items, such as nodes or time points, are shown - right in the place where they are positioned, thus supporting the user's overall mental map. Using this approach, a user can switch seamlessly between different visual representations to adapt a region of a base visualization to the specifics of the data within it or to the current analysis focus. This paper presents and discusses the in situ visualization strategy and its implications for dynamic graph visualization. Furthermore, it illustrates its usefulness by employing it for the visual exploration of dynamic networks from two different fields: model versioning and wireless mesh networks.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.213","teaser":"bccc9bd5-f323-4649-ba5d-54868ad0c821.png","author":"Hadlak, Steffen and Schulz, Hans-J\u00f6rg and Schumann, Heidrun","year":2011},{"id":510,"dataset_id":2,"name":"A Survey of Multi-faceted Graph Visualization","description":"Graph visualization is an important field in information visualization that is centered on the graphical display of graph-structured data.

In this paper, we investigate how information propagation in a specific microblogging platform evolves to identify relevant patterns and understand dynamic attributes of information propagation and the underlying sociological motivations. More specifically, based on the node-link diagram, we propose three efficient strategies to map the multiple attributes of information propagation graph to appropriate visual elements. For revealing the dynamic attributes, we propose two models: the depth-varying and the time-varying parallel data model to illustrate the temporal evolution efficiently. We also present a novel method by combining the traditional scatter plot with Hough transformation to represent the distribution of propagation instances and trace the propagation speeds. We integrate our methods to a visual mining tool and develop several interactive features. We demonstrate how our approaches improve the understanding of the propagation graph from a visual perspective by employing propagation datasets collected from Sina Weibo, the largest microblogging service provider in mainland China.

The highly dynamic and complex networks, represented as large graphs, make the analysis of such networks increasingly challenging. In this paper, we provide a brief overview of several useful visualization techniques for the analysis of spatiotemporal anomalies in large-scale networks. We make use of community-based similarity graphs (CSGs), temporal expansion model graphs (TEMGs), correlation graphs (CGs), high-dimension projection graphs (HDPGs), and topology-preserving compressed graphs (TPCGs). CSG is used to detect anomalies based on community membership changes rather than individual nodes and edges and therefore may be more tolerant to the highly dynamic nature of large networks. TEMG transforms network topologies into directed trees so that efficient search is more likely to be performed for anomalous changes in network behavior and routing topology in large dynamic networks. CG and HDPG are used to examine the complex relationship of data dimensions among graph nodes through transformation in a high-dimensional space. TPCG groups nodes with similar neighbor sets into mega-nodes, thus making graph visualization and analysis more scalable to large networks. All the methods target efficient large-graph anomaly visualization from different perspectives and together provide valuable insights.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1147/JRD.2013.2249356","teaser":"3334816f-82e8-436a-9719-eafe010a4f7b.png","author":"Liao, Qi and Shi, Lei and Wang, Chen","year":2013},{"id":533,"dataset_id":2,"name":"ContexTour: Contextual Contour Visual Analysis on Dynamic Multi-Relational Clustering","description":"Huge amounts of rich context social network data are generated everyday from various applications such as FaceBook and Twitter.

The usefulness of these graph representations depends on the quality of the layout of the graphs. Automatic graph layout, which can release humans from graph drawing, is now available in several visualization systems. Most automatic layout facilities take a purely combinatorial description of a graph and produce a layout of the graph; these methods are called 'layout creation' methods. For interactive systems, another kind of layout is needed: a facility which can adjust a layout after a change is made by the user or by the application. Although layout adjustment is essential in interactive systems, most existing layout algorithms are designed for layout creation. The use of a layout creation method for layout adjustment may totally rearrange the layout and thus destroy the user's 'mental map' of the diagram; thus a set of layout adjustment methods, separate from layout creation methods, is needed. This paper discusses some layout adjustment methods and the preservation of the 'mental map' of the diagram. First, several models are proposed to make the concept of 'mental map' more precise. Then two kinds of layout adjustments are described. One is an algorithm for rearranging a diagram to avoid overlapping nodes, and the other is a method aimed at changing the focus of interest of the user without destroying the mental map. Next, some experience with visualization systems in which the techniques have been employed is also described.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1006/jvlc.1995.1010","teaser":"0b3ccc12-1e05-46c4-b0c8-a1d2be863ac3.png","author":"Misue, Kazuo and Eades, Peter and Lai, Wei and Sugiyama, Kozo","year":1995},{"id":538,"dataset_id":2,"name":"Dynamic Network Visualisation","description":"Increased interest in longitudinal social networks and the recognition that visualization fosters theoretical insight create a need for dynamic network visualizations, or network \u201cmovies.\u201d This article confronts theoretical questions surrounding the temporal representations of social networks and technical questions about how best to link network change to changes in the graphical representation.

Drawings of these structures, as node and link diagrams, can provide a useful visualization of the underlying abstract data. This makes drawings of graphs a useful tool in information visualization. Indeed graph drawing has been applied in many application areas including software engineering, knowledge management and for depicting communication networks. The spatial layout can help the user build up a cognitive model or 'mental map' of the information structure. Many automatic algorithms for producing drawings of a graph have been implemented. In many domains it is also common for the underlying information to be dynamic and this means the graph drawing must be updated. Unfortunately, even small changes to the underlying data can result in dramatic changes to the final drawing and this means the user may totally lose their previous 'mental map'. Animation between the two versions of the layout is one approach that can assist the user to make the transition between the two drawings. We have been examining how to apply the Gestalt principles of organisation to this animation phase. The aim is to assist the user in understanding the structural and visual changes that have occurred in the layout.

Also, as the clustering is computed ahead of time, the second view updates in linear time which allows for interactivity even for graphs with upwards of tens of thousands of nodes.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-36763-2_43","teaser":"1c60cc74-ea49-4c97-b1e7-b78d5e91c02d.png","author":"Sallaberry, Arnaud and Muelder, Chris and Ma, Kwan-Liu","year":2012},{"id":558,"dataset_id":2,"name":"Visualization of Graphs with Associated Timeseries Data","description":"The most common approach to support analysis of graphs with associated time series data include: overlay of data on graph vertices for one timepoint at a time by manipulating a visual property (e.g. color) of the vertex, along with sliders or some such mechanism to animate the graph for other timepoints. Alternatively, data from all the timepoints can be overlaid simultaneously by embedding small charts into graph vertices. These graph visualizations may also be linked to other visualizations (e.g., parallel co-ordinates) using brushing and linking. This paper describes a study performed to evaluate and rank graph+timeseries visualization options based on users' performance time and accuracy of responses on predefined tasks. The results suggest that overlaying data on graph vertices one timepoint at a time may lead to more accurate performance for tasks involving analysis of a graph at a single timepoint, and comparisons between graph vertices for two distinct timepoints. Overlaying data simultaneously for all the timepoints on graph vertices may lead to more accurate and faster performance for tasks involving searching for outlier vertices displaying different behavior than the rest of the graph vertices for all timepoints. Single views have advantage over multiple views on tasks that require topological information. Also, the number of attributes displayed on nodes has a non trivial influence on accuracy of responses, whereas the number of visualizations affect the performance time.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.2005.1532151","teaser":"0c43f136-a569-4895-9772-488729921b91.png","author":"Saraiya, Purvi and Lee, Peter and North, Chris","year":2005},{"id":559,"dataset_id":2,"name":"Visualizing Dynamic Weighted Digraphs with Partial Links","description":"Graphs are traditionally represented as node-link diagrams, but these typically suffer from visual clutter when they become denser, i.e. more vertices and edges are present in the data set. Partial link drawings have been introduced for node-link diagrams aiming at reducing visual clutter caused by link crossings. Although this concept was shown to perform well for some parameter settings, it has not been used for visually encoding dynamic weighted digraphs. In this paper we investigate the problem of visualizing time-varying graphs as one node-link diagram in a specific layout by exploiting the links as timelines. Partially drawn links are used to show the graph dynamics by splitting each link into as many segments as time steps have to be represented. Conventional 2D layout algorithms can be applied while simultaneously showing the evolution over time. Color-coded links represent the changing weights. We use tapered links to reduce possible overlaps at the link target nodes that would occur when using traditional arrow-based directed links. We experiment with different graph layouts and different numbers of data dimensions, i.e. number of vertices, edges, and time steps. We illustrate the usefulness of the technique in a case study investigating dynamic migration data.","url":"https://doi.org/10.5220/0005303801230130","teaser":"e57a73f8-fa05-48c6-8466-71fa085dbe28.png","author":"Schmauder, Hansj\u00f6rg and Burch, Michael and Weiskopf, Daniel","year":2015},{"id":560,"dataset_id":2,"name":"Considerations in Dynamic Graph Drawing: A Survey","description":"In this survey paper we discuss the considerations involved in modeling, visualising and exploring dynamic graphs\u2014those graphs which are continually changing in structure to reflect the evolution of the system they are representing.

One of the main reasons for this is that models facilitate the integration of a multitude of different data and data types using parameter estimation. Thereby, models allow for a holistic understanding of biological processes. However, due to measurement noise and the limited amount of data, uncertainties in the model parameters should be considered when conclusions are drawn from estimated model attributes, such as reaction fluxes or transient dynamics of biological species. We developed the visual analytics system iVUN that supports uncertainty-aware analysis of static and dynamic attributes of biochemical reaction networks modeled by ordinary differential equations. The multivariate graph of the network is visualized as a node-link diagram, and statistics of the attributes are mapped to the color of nodes and links of the graph. In addition, the graph view is linked with several views, such as line plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices, to support locating uncertainties and the analysis of their time dependencies. As demonstration, we use iVUN to quantitatively analyze the dynamics of a model for Epo-induced JAK2/STAT5 signaling. Our case study showed that iVUN can be used to perform an in-depth study of biochemical reaction networks, including attribute uncertainties, correlations between these attributes and their uncertainties as well as the attribute dynamics. In particular, the linking of different visualization options turned out to be highly beneficial for the complex analysis tasks that come with the biological systems as presented here.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-14-S19-S2","teaser":"342db5fb-69ad-4900-a836-95165d92aaf9.png","author":"Vehlow, Corinna and Hasenauer, Jan and Kramer, Andrei and Raue, Andreas and Hug, Sabine and Timmer, Jens and Radde, Nicole and Theis, Fabian J and Weiskopf, Daniel","year":2013},{"id":570,"dataset_id":2,"name":"Radial Layered Matrix Visualization of Dynamic Graphs","description":"We propose a novel radial layered matrix visualization for dynamic directed weighted graphs in which the vertices can also be hierarchically organized.

a clinical trial. A model may inadvertently and implicitly store some of its training data; careful analysis of the model may therefore reveal sensitive information.  To address this problem, we demonstrate a generally applicable approach to providing strong privacy guarantees for training data: Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE). The approach combines, in a black-box fashion, multiple models trained with disjoint datasets, such as records from different subsets of users. Because they rely directly on sensitive data, these models are not published, but instead used as ''teachers'' for a ''student'' model.  The student learns to predict an output chosen by noisy voting among all of the teachers, and cannot directly access an individual teacher or the underlying data or parameters. The student's privacy properties can be understood both intuitively (since no single teacher and thus no single dataset dictates the student's training) and formally, in terms of differential privacy.  These properties hold even if an adversary can not only query the student but also inspect its internal workings.  Compared with previous work, the approach imposes only weak assumptions on how teachers are trained: it applies to any model, including non-convex models like DNNs. We achieve state-of-the-art privacy/utility trade-offs on MNIST and SVHN thanks to an improved privacy analysis and semi-supervised learning.","url":"","teaser":"","authors":"Nicolas Papernot, Mart\u00edn Abadi, \u00dalfar Erlingsson, Ian Goodfellow, Kunal Talwar","acceptance":"accepted"},{"id":583,"dataset_id":3,"name":"Learning to Generate Samples from Noise through Infusion Training","description":"In this work, we investigate a novel training procedure to learn a generative model as the transition operator of a Markov chain, such that, when applied repeatedly on an unstructured random noise sample, it will denoise it into a sample that matches the target distribution from the training set.

The current standard approach to modeling neurons is to start with simple models and to incrementally add interpretable features. An alternative approach is to start with a more complex model that captures responses accurately, and then probe the fitted model structure to understand the neural computations. Here, we show that a multitask recurrent neural network (RNN) framework provides the flexibility necessary to model complex computations of neurons that cannot be captured by previous methods. Specifically, multilayer recurrent neural networks that share features across neurons outperform generalized linear models (GLMs) in predicting the spiking responses of parasol ganglion cells in the primate retina to natural images. The networks achieve good predictive performance given surprisingly small amounts of experimental training data. Additionally, we present a novel GLM-RNN hybrid model with separate spatial and temporal processing components which provides insights into the aspects of retinal processing better captured by the recurrent neural networks.","url":"","teaser":"","authors":"Eleanor Batty, Josh Merel, Nora Brackbill, Alexander Heitman, Alexander Sher, Alan Litke, E.J.

Here, we explore prediction of future frames in a video sequence as an unsupervised learning rule for learning about the structure of the visual world. We describe a predictive neural network (\"PredNet\") architecture that is inspired by the concept of \"predictive coding\" from the neuroscience literature. These networks learn to predict future frames in a video sequence, with each layer in the network making local predictions and only forwarding deviations from those predictions to subsequent network layers. We show that these networks are able to robustly learn to predict the movement of synthetic (rendered) objects, and that in doing so, the networks learn  internal representations that are useful for decoding latent object parameters (e.g. pose) that support object recognition with fewer training views. We also show that these networks can scale to complex natural image streams (car-mounted camera videos), capturing key aspects of both egocentric movement and the movement of objects in the visual scene, and the representation learned in this setting is useful for estimating the steering angle. These results suggest that prediction represents a powerful framework for unsupervised learning, allowing for implicit learning of object and scene structure.","url":"","teaser":"","authors":"William Lotter, Gabriel Kreiman, David Cox","acceptance":"accepted"},{"id":587,"dataset_id":3,"name":"Training Agent for First-Person Shooter Game with Actor-Critic Curriculum Learning","description":"In this paper, we propose a novel framework for training vision-based agent for First-Person Shooter (FPS) Game, in particular Doom.

Given a set of input-output examples, these architectures are able to learn mappings that generalize to new test inputs. While achieving impressive results, these approaches have a number of important limitations: (a) they are computationally expensive and hard to train, (b) a model has to be trained for each task (program) separately, and (c) it is hard to interpret or verify the correctness of the learnt mapping (as it is defined by a neural network). In this paper, we propose a novel technique, Neuro-Symbolic Program Synthesis, to overcome the above-mentioned problems. Once trained, our approach can automatically construct computer programs in a domain-specific language that are consistent with a set of input-output examples provided at test time. Our method is based on two novel neural modules. The first module, called the cross correlation I/O network, given a set of input-output examples, produces a continuous representation of the set of I/O examples. The second module, the Recursive-Reverse-Recursive Neural Network (R3NN), given the continuous representation of the examples, synthesizes a program by incrementally expanding partial programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the rich and complex domain of regular expression based string transformations. Experiments show that the R3NN model is not only able to construct programs from new input-output examples, but it is also able to construct new programs for tasks that it had never observed before during training.","url":"","teaser":"","authors":"Emilio Parisotto, Abdel-rahman Mohamed, Rishabh Singh, Lihong Li, Dengyong Zhou, Pushmeet Kohli","acceptance":"accepted"},{"id":589,"dataset_id":3,"name":"Autoencoding Variational Inference For Topic Models","description":"Topic models are one of the most popular methods for learning representations of text, but a major challenge is that any change to the topic model requires mathematically deriving a new inference algorithm. A promising approach to address this problem is autoencoding variational Bayes (AEVB), but it has proven diffi- cult to apply to topic models in practice. We present what is to our knowledge the first effective AEVB based inference method for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), which we call Autoencoded Variational Inference For Topic Model (AVITM). This model tackles the problems caused for AEVB by the Dirichlet prior and by component collapsing. We find that AVITM matches traditional methods in accuracy with much better inference time. Indeed, because of the inference network, we find that it is unnecessary to pay the computational cost of running variational optimization on test data. Because AVITM is black box, it is readily applied to new topic models. As a dramatic illustration of this, we present a new topic model called ProdLDA, that replaces the mixture model in LDA with a product of experts. By changing only one line of code from LDA, we find that ProdLDA yields much more interpretable topics, even if LDA is trained via collapsed Gibbs sampling.","url":"","teaser":"","authors":"Akash Srivastava, Charles Sutton","acceptance":"accepted"},{"id":590,"dataset_id":3,"name":"A Simple but Tough-to-Beat Baseline for Sentence Embeddings","description":"The success of neural network methods for computing word embeddings has motivated methods for generating semantic embeddings of longer pieces of text, such as sentences and paragraphs. Surprisingly, Wieting et al (ICLR'16) showed that such complicated methods are outperformed, especially in out-of-domain (transfer learning) settings, by simpler methods involving mild retraining of word embeddings and basic linear regression. The  method of Wieting et al. requires retraining with a substantial labeled dataset such as Paraphrase Database (Ganitkevitch et al., 2013).   The current paper goes further, showing that the following completely unsupervised sentence embedding is a formidable baseline: Use word embeddings computed using one of the popular methods on unlabeled corpus like Wikipedia, represent the sentence by a weighted average of the word vectors, and then modify them a bit using PCA/SVD. This weighting improves performance by about 10% to 30% in textual similarity tasks, and beats sophisticated supervised methods including RNN's and LSTM's. It even improves Wieting et al.'s embeddings.   This simple method should be used as the baseline to beat in future, especially when labeled training data is scarce or nonexistent.   The paper also gives a theoretical explanation of the success of the above unsupervised method using a latent variable generative model for sentences, which is a simple extension of the model in Arora et al.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence have yielded machines that can achieve superhuman performance in Go, Atari, natural language processing, and complex control problems; however, it is not clear that these systems can rival the scientific intuition of even a young child. In this work we introduce a basic set of tasks that require agents to estimate properties such as mass and cohesion of objects in an interactive simulated environment where they can manipulate the objects and observe the consequences. We found that deep reinforcement learning methods can learn to perform the experiments necessary to discover such hidden properties. By systematically manipulating the problem difficulty and the cost incurred by the agent for performing experiments, we found that agents learn different strategies that balance the cost of gathering information against the cost of making mistakes in different situations.

An action sequence is considered under-appreciated if its log-probability under the current policy under-estimates its resulting reward. The proposed exploration strategy is easy to implement, requiring only small modifications to the standard REINFORCE algorithm. We evaluate the approach on a set of algorithmic tasks that have long challenged RL methods.

Because of their sequential nature, RNNs are good at capturing the local structure of a word sequence \u2013 both semantic and syntactic \u2013 but might face difficulty remembering long-range dependencies. Intuitively, these long-range dependencies are of semantic nature. In contrast, latent topic models are able to capture the global underlying semantic structure of a document but do not account for word ordering. The proposed TopicRNN model integrates the merits of RNNs and latent topic models: it captures local (syntactic) dependencies using an RNN and global (semantic) dependencies using latent topics. Unlike previous work on contextual RNN language modeling, our model is learned end-to-end. Empirical results on word prediction show that TopicRNN outperforms existing contextual RNN baselines. In addition, TopicRNN can be used as an unsupervised feature extractor for documents. We do this for sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset and report an error rate of 6.28%. This is comparable to the state-of-the-art 5.91% resulting from a semi-supervised approach.

Our main practical result is to show that random networks may be trained precisely when information can travel through them. Thus, the depth scales that we identify provide bounds on how deep a network may be trained for a specific choice of hyperparameters. As a corollary to this, we argue that in networks at the edge of chaos, one of these depth scales diverges. Thus arbitrarily deep networks may be trained only sufficiently close to criticality. We show that the presence of dropout destroys the order-to-chaos critical point and therefore strongly limits the maximum trainable depth for random networks. Finally, we develop a mean field theory for backpropagation and we show that the ordered and chaotic phases correspond to regions of vanishing and exploding gradient respectively.","url":"","teaser":"","authors":"Samuel S.

In particular, it is unclear what makes hypotheses spaces born from convolution and pooling operations so suitable for natural images. In this paper we study the ability of convolutional networks to model correlations among regions of their input. We theoretically analyze convolutional arithmetic circuits, and empirically validate our findings on other types of convolutional networks as well. Correlations are formalized through the notion of separation rank, which for a given partition of the input, measures how far a function is from being separable. We show that a polynomially sized deep network supports exponentially high separation ranks for certain input partitions, while being limited to polynomial separation ranks for others. The network's pooling geometry effectively determines which input partitions are favored, thus serves as a means for controlling the inductive bias. Contiguous pooling windows as commonly employed in practice favor interleaved partitions over coarse ones, orienting the inductive bias towards the statistics of natural images. Other pooling schemes lead to different preferences, and this allows tailoring the network to data that departs from the usual domain of natural imagery. In addition to analyzing deep networks, we show that shallow ones support only linear separation ranks, and by this gain insight into the benefit of functions brought forth by depth - they are able to efficiently model strong correlation under favored partitions of the input.","url":"","teaser":"","authors":"Nadav Cohen, Amnon Shashua","acceptance":"accepted"},{"id":599,"dataset_id":3,"name":"Hierarchical Multiscale Recurrent Neural Networks","description":"Learning both hierarchical and temporal representation has been among the long- standing challenges of recurrent neural networks.

In this paper, we propose a novel multiscale approach, called the hierarchical multiscale recurrent neural network, that can capture the latent hierarchical structure in the sequence by encoding the temporal dependencies with different timescales using a novel update mechanism.

Inferring likely structures from few examples is a complex task often requiring the formulation of priors and sophisticated inference procedures. In the setting of Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) a popular estimator is a maximum likelihood objective with a penalization on the precision matrix. Adapting this estimator to capture domain-specific knowledge as priors or a new data likelihood requires great effort. In addition, structure recovery is an indirect consequence of the data-fit term. By contrast, it may be easier to generate training samples of data that arise from graphs with the desired structure properties. We propose here to leverage this latter source of information as training data to learn a function mapping from empirical covariance matrices to estimated graph structures.  Learning this function brings two benefits: it implicitly models the desired structure or sparsity properties to form suitable priors, and it can be tailored to the specific problem of edge structure discovery, rather than maximizing data likelihood. We apply this framework to several real-world problems in structure discovery and show that it can be competitive to standard approaches such as graphical lasso, at a fraction of the execution speed. We use convolutional neural networks to parametrize our estimators due to the compositional structure of the problem. Experimentally, our learnable graph-discovery method trained on synthetic data generalizes well to different data: identifying relevant edges in real data, completely unknown at training time. We find that on genetics, brain imaging, and simulation data we obtain competitive(and generally superior) performance, compared with analytical methods.","url":"","teaser":"","authors":"Eugene Belilovsky, Kyle Kastner, Gael Varoquaux, Matthew B.

Recent successes in deep reinforcement learning have been achieved mostly using simple heuristic exploration strategies such as $\\epsilon$-greedy action selection or Gaussian control noise, but there are many tasks where these methods are insufficient to make any learning progress. Here, we consider more complex heuristics: efficient and scalable exploration strategies that maximize a notion of an agent's surprise about its experiences via intrinsic motivation. We propose to learn a model of the MDP transition probabilities concurrently with the policy, and to form intrinsic rewards that approximate the KL-divergence of the true transition probabilities from the learned model. One of our approximations results in using surprisal as intrinsic motivation, while the other gives the $k$-step learning progress.

On the other hand, it is well known that hard attention mechanisms based on reinforcement learning are challenging to train successfully. In this paper, we explore a form of hierarchical memory network, which can be considered as a hybrid between hard and soft attention memory networks. The memory is organized in a hierarchical structure such that reading from it is done with less computation than soft attention over a flat memory, while also being easier to train than hard attention over a flat memory.

In their general form, TMMs are intractable as the priors tensor is typically of exponential size. However, when the priors tensor is decomposed it gives rise to an arithmetic circuit which in turn transforms the TMM into a Convolutional Arithmetic Circuit (ConvAC). A ConvAC corresponds to a shallow (single hidden layer) network when the priors tensor is decomposed by a CP (sum of rank-1) approach and corresponds to a deep network when the decomposition follows the Hierarchical Tucker (HT) model.  The ConvAC representation of a TMM possesses several attractive properties. First, the inference is tractable and is implemented by a forward pass through a deep network. Second, the architectural design of the model follows the deep networks community design, i.e.,  the structure of TMMs is determined by just two easily understood factors: size of pooling windows and number of channels.
